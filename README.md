# NGP C-Model
## Introduction
This is a C Model of instant-ngp. All modules are implemented by C++, only with `Eigen`.

It's more convinient for translate this C Model to RTL code; besides, if you are interest in NGP's implementation, you can read this code.

> Now, only an Lego model is supported. I will quickly inplement `.msgpack` loading
> The test data is too big. If you need it, please contact me.

## Quick Start
